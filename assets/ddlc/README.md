## Doki Doki Literature Club Website

This is an archive of [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe).

I think the website is really cute and I'm a big fan of the game so I wanted to archive it.

I've also made a few changes to the website:

- Changed the Youtube embed to an `<a>` tag

- Removed the use of an `<iframe>` for the [itch.io](https://itch.io) banner (added the banner directly myself)

- Added a jumping css animation when Javascript is disabled for the little characters at the bottom
