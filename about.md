# About Me

I'm Minno. The creator of this website. You might know me by my real name, although you won't find it here.

Currently, I'm in my third year at Ontario Tech University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science.

I love software. In terms of development, I am interested in backend development and anything without a GUI, although that can be fun sometimes. In my free time, I develop software to solve my problems and learn new things. I dabble in many areas, including web scraping, databases, APIs, image processing, and automation. Lately, I've been delving into Linux servers, devops and continuous integration using Jenkins, which powers [EZCampus](https://ezcampus.org/).

I'm a strong advocate for open-source, and I like to contribute whenever possible. You can find me most active:

- On my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/minnowo), where I share code, dotfiles, and host my website ([minnowo.github.io](https://github.com/minnowo/minnowo.github.io)).
- Leading as the backend developer, devops engineer, and data engineer at [EZCampus](https://github.com/EZCampusDevs).
- Collaborating with friends on diverse projects under [Gank-Squad](https://github.com/Gank-Squad).

I'm not particularly active on social media, so if you'd like to contact me, you can email me at [minnobrine@gmail.com](mailto:minnobrine@gmail.com). Alternatively, if you've been given my contact information from a business card or someone else, you should use that instead.

# About This Site

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site was initially based on [Jekyll-Clean-Dark](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark). Through the removal of all Javascript, a complete CSS rewrite, and removing web bloat, it has transformed into it's current state.

The motivation behind creating this site, was to have a platform where I could post notes, guides and links to resources, as well as archive information with it all being readily available.

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/minnowo/minnowo.github.io).
