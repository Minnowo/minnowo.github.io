## YT-DLP

[CLI] [Video]

Better [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), good for downloading videos from almost anywhere.

## Gallery-dl

[CLI] [Galleries]

My goto program for downloading galleries of files, great for boorus, pixiv, twitter and the like.

## Fanbox-dl

[CLI] [Pixiv-Fanbox] [Galleries]

Probably the best Pixiv Fanbox downloader I've come accross, really easy to use, and able to batch download entire pages. Just inspect element, find the storage tab / where cookies are saved, and find FANBOXSESSID.

## JDownloader 2

[GUI] [DDL] [Video] [General]

Really solid downloader manager, can write your own download rules and filters, supports a lot of websites and also good for direct-downloads. Probably the best general purpose GUI download manager. Just avoid the adware infested installer.
