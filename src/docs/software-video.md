# Video Software

## MPV

[GUI] [CLI] [Video] [Audio]

My favorite video player. Plays everything under the sun and streams piped from other applications such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/). 

Can be used to extend other applications via [libmpv](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#embedding-into-other-programs-libmpv), and supports [scripting](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts) which can further extend functionality.

Can be controlled from the terminal and by using `--video=no --force-window=no` you can play audio with just the terminal window.

## VLC

[GUI] [Video] [Audio]

Probably the most popular video player. Plays everything under the sun and I'm assuming it can play streams piped from other applications such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/), but I've never used it. 

Can be used to extend other applications via [libvlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/libvlc.html).

## Kodi

[GUI] [Video] [Audio]

A home theater / media center, has a very extensive list of plugins and is very good for managing tv shows, movies, and other videos of your choice.

Plugins are written using python3.
