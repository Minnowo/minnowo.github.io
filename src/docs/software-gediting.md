# Editing / Painting Software

## Gimp

[GUI] [Editing]

It's pretty good for editing and working with images, but It's not Photoshop.

## Krita

[GUI] [Editing] [Drawing]

My personal choice for drawing software, has some features Gimp lacks but is better suited for drawing and digital art rather than editing.

## Aseprite

[GUI] [Pixel Art] [Drawing]

Pixel art and sprite animations, free if you compile it yourself, or find binaries from a third party.

## Grafx2

[GUI] [Drawing]

This feels like a mix of Aseprite and mspaint.
