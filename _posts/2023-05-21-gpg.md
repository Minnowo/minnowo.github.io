**NOTE**: if you're on Windows, you should install [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/). [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) may also provide the gpg utility.

<br>

## What is GPG

GPG ([GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/)) or GNU Privacy Guard is a versatile key management system allowing you to encrypt and sign data and communications.

<br>

## Checking version

```sh
$ gpg --version

## Generating a key

To generate a default key you can use `gpg --gen-key`, to get more options you can use `gpg --full-generate-key`.

For a guide on the first command see [here](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html).

Lets generate a key:
```sh
$ gpg --full-generate-key
```

The first option is to pick the type of key, for this I am going to go with the default `RSA and RSA` (1), you can pick whichever based off preference and use case.
```
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.40; Copyright (C) 2022 g10 Code GmbH
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1
```

Next we need to choose how many bits we want, personally I like to pick something 3072 or more, but you can read more about large RSA keys [here](https://wiki.gnupg.org/LargeKeys).

For this key, I'm going to stick again with the default of 3072.
```
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 3072
```

Once we've chosen a key and bit length, we need to choose when it should expire. It is good practice to have keys expire every few years ([though frequent expirey doesn't mean security]({% post_url 2015-01-15-gpg-expirey-security %})). For personal use I like to make my keys expire every 2 years, so for this key I'm going to choose that.

```
Requested keysize is 3072 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y
```

We then need to associate a name with the key, pick a name you're good with, ideally something used to identify you or whoever is going to be using the key. I'm going to set the name for this to be `hello world`.
```
Key expires at Tue 20 May 2025 08:45:54 PM EDT
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: hello world 
```

You will then be prompted to enter an email address, this is **optional**, so I am going to leave it blank.
```
Email address: 
```

Next you get the option to add a comment, put something here to help you remember what the key is for. This is **optional**.
```
Comment: This is a test key 
```

Once you've finished you will get the option to edit these fields in case you made a mistake, I'm happy with this key so I'm going to choose okay.
```
You selected this USER-ID:
    "hello world (This is a test key)"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
```

The last step (**optional**), is to enter a passphrase, you will likely get a dialog or prompt in your terminal to enter it, here's what mine looks like:
![Password Entry Box](/assets/custom/pictures/2023-05-21_gpg-password-entry.jpg)

You should protect your key with a passphrase to ensure that it cannot be used by anyone who doesn't know the passphrase. Ideally this would be strong enough to resist brute force for enough to time revoke the key, or even better forever.

Once you've set a passphrase, you will see an output like this:
```
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa3072 2023-05-22 [SC] [expires: 2025-05-21]

sub   rsa3072 2023-05-22 [E] [expires: 2025-05-21]
```

This is your new GPG key, your key can be identified via the `fingerprint`, which is the long string show above the `uid`, mine for this key is `B44FA5959352450581BAE339E135DD909794B108`

## Quick usage

<br>

### Listing keys

To see **public** keys you have:
```sh
$ gpg --list-keys
```

To see **private** keys you have:
```sh
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
```

<br>

### Exporting keys


To export the a **public** key:
```sh
$ gpg --output "some-file-path.gpg" --armor --export "fingerprint / user-id" 
```

To export a **private** key:
```sh
$ gpg --output "some-file-path.asc" --armor --export-secret-keys "fingerprint / user-id" 
```

- `--output` or `-o` is used to specify the output file for the key, or if not specified it puts it into stdout.

- `--armor` wraps the key into ASCII instead of binary format. 

- `--export` is determines which **public** key to export, where `fingerprint / user-id` is either the fingerprint of the key you want to export, or the name / email on that key.

- `--export-secret-keys` is determines which **private** key to export, where `fingerprint / user-id` is either the fingerprint of the key you want to export, or the name / email on that key.

**NOTE**: order matters here, `--export` and `--export-secret-keys` should usually be last

<br>

### Importing keys

To import a **public** or **private** key:
```sh
$ gpg --import "some-file-path.gpg"
```

<br>

### Signing / trusting keys

Once you have imported someones public key, signing that key will tell your software you trust and have verified that it is associated with the person in question.

To sign a key you've imported:
```sh
$ gpg --sign-key "fingerprint / user-id"
```

If you have multiple **private** keys, you can specify which key to sign with using `--default-key` and the fingerprint or user-id.

Once you've signed their key, you can export it and send it back to them. This lets them import the key to gain a "stamp of approval" when interacting with others.


<br>

### Encrypting data

Once you have someones **public** key, you can use it to encrypt a message for them.

This can be done like so:
```sh
$ gpg --encrypt --sign --armor --recipient "name" "path-to-file"
```

- `--encrypt` encrypts the file with the recipient's public key.

- `--sign` (**optionally**) signs the file with your private key.

- `--armor` wraps the data in ASCII instead of binary format.

- `--recipient` or `-r` specifies the public key using it's name

- lastly the path to the file you want to encrypt / sign

If you have multiple **private** keys, you can specify which key to sign with using `--default-key` and the fingerprint or user-id.

<br>

### Signing data

To sign a piece of data with your **private** key:
```sh
$ gpg --sign "path-to-file"
```

If you want to make a message readable, but still sign it with your **private** key, you can use `--clearsign`. 
```sh
$ gpg --clearsign "path-to-file"
```

This will output something like:
```
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

hello world

### Verifying signed data

You can decrypt / verify using:
```sh
$ gpg "path-to-file"
```

If you do not have the public key of the signer, you will get something like:
```
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: Signature made Mon 22 May 2023 01:54:11 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key E6858A2EF834FE194113EC56B5E504E1ECA46D32
gpg:                issuer "62451415+minnowo@users.noreply.github.com"
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
```

If you have the public key, but did not trust it, you will get something like:
```
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: Signature made Mon 22 May 2023 01:54:11 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key E6858A2EF834FE194113EC56B5E504E1ECA46D32
gpg:                issuer "62451415+minnowo@users.noreply.github.com"
gpg: Good signature from "Minnowo (Alice Nyaa) Github <62451415+Minnowo@users.noreply.github.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: E685 8A2E F834 FE19 4113  EC56 B5E5 04E1 ECA4 6D32
```

If you have the public key and trust it, you will get something like:
```
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: Signature made Mon 22 May 2023 01:54:11 AM EDT
gpg:                using RSA key E6858A2EF834FE194113EC56B5E504E1ECA46D32
gpg:                issuer "62451415+minnowo@users.noreply.github.com"
gpg: Good signature from "Minnowo (Alice Nyaa) Github <62451415+Minnowo@users.noreply.github.com>" [full]
```

You can use `--output` or `-o` to specify the output file of any encrypted / signed data.

**NOTE**: the input file should be specified last after any parameters you provid
