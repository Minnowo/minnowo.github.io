For extensive information see the [docker reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/). It has all of the information here and is more in-depth.

This is more of highlight / quick useful things you to remember.

<br>

## Docker without sudo

You need to add your user to the `docker` group:
```sh
$ sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
``` 

You probably need to restart terminal or logout for this to take effect.

<br>

## Docker run

[Docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) is what lets you spin up containers from images.
```sh
$ docker run <image>
```

Useful flags:

- `--name <name>`: sets the container name

- `--rm`: delete the container as soon as it stop

- `--publish` or `-p`: maps a containers ports to host ports 

    ```sh
    $ docker run -p <host>:<container> <image>
    ```

    if you want to restrict them to a certain subnet:
    ```sh
    $ docker run -p <subnet>:<host>:<container> <image>
    ```

    for example, to map port 8080 to 8080 and have it only accessible over localhost:
    ```sh
    $ docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 <image>
    ```

- `--interactive` or `-i`: connect to the STDIN of the command inside the container 

- `--tty` or `-t`: gives a tty (usually not useful without `-i` option)

- `--detach` or `-d`: runs container in the background

- `--network <network>`: connect the container to a network (useful for containers which need to communicate) 


<br>

## Networks

[Networks](https://docs.docker.com/network/) let you connect containers to other containers or workloads.

Lets say for example you are running a [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) database in a docker container and an app which connects to the database in a different container. Normally you would just connect over `localhost`, but since your app is in a container, `localhost` in your app's container is not the same as inside the MySQL container.

You can create a network to connect your app to the database.

First create the network:
```sh
$ docker network create <network-name>
```

Once you have a network, you need to connect both your containers to it. 

For existing containers:
```sh
$ docker network connect <network-name> <container-id>
```

Or when making a container using [docker run](#docker-run):
```sh
$ docker run --network <network-name> <image>
```

Now that both the containers are on the same network, instead of using `localhost` for your apps connection, you can use the name of the MySQL container. This will automatically resolve to the ip of the MySQL container.

<br>

## Quick usage

<br>

### Listing containers

You can running containers:
```sh
$ docker ps
```

Or the long way:
```sh
$ docker container ls
```

To see all containers add the `-a` flag to either command.

<br>

### Removing containers

You can remove a container using:
```sh
$ docker rm <container-id> 
```

<br>

### Listing images

You can show all images using:
```sh
$ docker image ls
```

<br>

### Removing images

You can remove an image like so:
```sh
$ docker image rm <image-name>
```

<br>

#### Removing none images

When [listing images](#listing-images) there is usually a bunch called `<none>`.

To properly remove them without breaking stuff run:
```sh
$ docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q) 
```
